            "Complex systems are systems whose behaviour is intrinsically difficult to model due to the
            dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other interactions between their parts or between a given
            system and its environment." Biology is packed with complex systems which are often challenging to
            comprehend. Genetta represents genetic designs as networks. This representation allows analysis and
            transformations to be applied to tailor visualisation based on requirements.
